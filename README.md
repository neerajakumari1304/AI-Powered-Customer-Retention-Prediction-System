# AI-Powered-Customer-Retention-Prediction-System
The goal of this project is to analyze customer data from a telecommunications company to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) or stay.

## 🧩 Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### 🎯 Objective
The purpose of EDA is to analyze the telecom dataset and identify key drivers of customer churn. Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, we visualize customer demographics, service usage, and billing patterns to uncover why customers leave. These insights form the foundation for predictive modeling and retention strategies.
